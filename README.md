## Data

The benchmark simulation test dataset can be accessed [here] (https://github.com/Jiamian-Wang/HSI_baseline/tree/main/Data/testing/simu). Make sure to specify the ```test_path``` before evaluation.
The coded apture can be accessed [here] (https://github.com/Jiamian-Wang/HSI_baseline/tree/main/Data). Make sure to specify the ```mask_path``` before evaluation. 

## Three versions of proposed method

Checkpoint of ```model v1```: w/o rescaling pairs can be accessed [here] (https://github.com/Jiamian-Wang/HSI_baseline/tree/main/models/v1)
Similarly, pre-trained models of the other two versions are also been released. 
Makre sure to specify the ```model_path``` as desired pre-trained model.
